// Interactivity with the header

// Interactivity with the navbar

// Interactity with the body

// Interactivity with the footer



// Code favorites feature

// Create an array that the user can input values into

// Save that array to localStorage

// Have the user be able to retrieve that information from localStorage (Can the user retrieve it or it already just displayed?)



// After the user searches for a holiday, next to the "go back" button they will see another button that says "save to favorites"

// If they press this button the data will be saved to an array that will be saved to localStorage

// This array will then be displayed in the "Favorites: " section

// I'll need a for loop for the display code
